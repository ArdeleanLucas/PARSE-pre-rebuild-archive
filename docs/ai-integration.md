> This document consolidates the AI provider system, model roles, configuration expectations, and the full built-in PARSE chat tool surface currently described in the repository README and code.

PARSE is AI-native, but not in the sense of a generic chatbot pasted onto a UI. Different tasks route to different providers and model families, and the in-app assistant operates through a bounded PARSE-specific tool layer.

## Provider system at a glance

PARSE routes AI work by task type rather than forcing one model/provider to do everything.

| Task | Supported providers |
|---|---|
| STT (speech-to-text) | faster-whisper (local), OpenAI Whisper API |
| IPA transcription | acoustic wav2vec2 via `ipa_only` compute |
| LLM / chat | xAI (Grok), OpenAI |

A single project can therefore mix providers across tasks:

- local STT / ORTH for speech work
- wav2vec2 for alignment and acoustic IPA
- OpenAI or xAI for workflow chat

Configuration lives in `config/ai_config.json`.

## Configuration model

PARSE expects a machine-local config file:

```bash
cp config/ai_config.example.json config/ai_config.json
```

The file is gitignored because it includes machine-specific paths and secrets.

If the file is missing, the backend can still start with built-in defaults, but runtime behavior will not necessarily match a thesis-ready setup.

### Key config sections

#### `stt`

This block controls the main speech-to-text provider.

Current template:

```json
"stt": {
  "provider": "faster-whisper",
  "model_path": "",
  "language": "ku",
  "device": "cuda",
  "compute_type": "float16",
  "beam_size": 5
}
```

Operational notes from the current README and template:

- faster-whisper is the main local STT backend
- word-level timestamps are enabled in the pipeline
- language can be auto-detected from project metadata when available
- the intended workflow is GPU-backed local inference
- the current README notes explicit CUDA-runtime detection, an emergency `PARSE_STT_FORCE_CPU=1` override, and a CPU/int8 fallback if the local CUDA stack is unavailable
- mid-run CUDA failures rebuild the Whisper model on CPU instead of leaving the job wedged

#### `ortho`

This block configures the orthographic transcription path.

Current template:

```json
"ortho": {
  "provider": "faster-whisper",
  "model_path": "razhan/whisper-base-sdh",
  "language": "sd",
  "device": "cuda",
  "compute_type": "float16",
  "beam_size": 5,
  "vad_filter": false,
  "initial_prompt": "",
  "refine_lexemes": false
}
```

Key behavior:

- **Razhan** is the canonical Southern Kurdish orthographic model
- `vad_filter` defaults to **false** for full-waveform coverage in ORTH mode
- `initial_prompt` can prime the Whisper decoder for elicitation-style recordings
- `refine_lexemes=true` adds a short-clip lexeme refinement pass after forced alignment

#### `ipa` + `wav2vec2`

The current PARSE architecture makes acoustic IPA a dedicated wav2vec2 stage rather than a text-derived fallback.

```json
"ipa": {
  "engine": "wav2vec2",
  "model": "facebook/wav2vec2-xlsr-53-espeak-cv-ft",
  "model_only": true
},
"wav2vec2": {
  "provider": "wav2vec2-ipa",
  "model": "facebook/wav2vec2-xlsr-53-espeak-cv-ft",
  "device": "cuda",
  "force_cpu": false,
  "chunk_size": 150
}
```

Important design point: the older Epitran / text-to-IPA / LLM IPA paths are gone from the main workflow described in the current README.

#### `llm` and `chat`

These blocks configure the workflow assistant.

```json
"llm": {
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-5.4",
  "api_key_env": "OPENAI_API_KEY"
},
"chat": {
  "enabled": true,
  "read_only": false,
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-5.4",
  "api_key_env": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
  "temperature": 0.1,
  "max_tool_rounds": 4,
  "max_history_messages": 24,
  "max_output_tokens": 1400
}
```

Supported provider families for chat are currently:

- **OpenAI**
- **xAI / Grok**

## Current model roles

### `razhan/whisper-base-sdh`

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Task | ORTH transcription / Southern Kurdish speech recognition |
| Source | HuggingFace (local CT2 path or repo id) |
| Role in PARSE | Speaker-level orthographic transcription for Southern Kurdish recordings |

The current README emphasizes that Razhan produces **Kurdish Arabic-script orthographic transcription with word-level timestamps**. It is **not** the IPA engine.

### `facebook/wav2vec2-xlsr-53-espeak-cv-ft`

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Task | Tier 2 forced alignment + Tier 3 acoustic IPA |
| Source | HuggingFace (local) |
| Role in PARSE | Tightens word boundaries and generates phoneme output from audio slices |

Current behavior described in the README:

- Tier 2 forced alignment refines Tier 1 word windows
- Tier 3 IPA prefers the word-level STT cache when available
- If no STT word cache exists, PARSE falls back to coarse ORTH-interval slices
- On WSL, the aligner now resolves to **CPU by default** for long wav2vec2 CTC workloads
- `config/ai_config.json` exposes `wav2vec2.force_cpu` and `wav2vec2.chunk_size` so long runs can be tuned without code changes
- recent fixes also cache `EspeakBackend` instances per language and report progress during Tier 2 forced alignment, which matters most on slower CPU-heavy WSL runs

### Silero VAD

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Task | Voice activity detection |
| Source | Bundled with faster-whisper |
| Role in PARSE | Segment boundary detection for long recordings in Whisper-style decoding |

The current README notes that Silero VAD parameters are tuned for elicitation recordings with soft-spoken consultants and variable microphone distance.

### faster-whisper + CTranslate2

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| `faster-whisper` | Local STT / ORTH inference backend |
| `CTranslate2` | Optimized runtime for Whisper-family models |

These components underpin local inference for the speech-heavy parts of PARSE.

## External dependency links worth citing

The current README includes a citation-oriented table for core external models and repositories directly referenced by PARSE.

## The AI workflow assistant

Both Annotate and Compare modes include a built-in assistant powered by the configured LLM provider.

The current README describes it as a **domain-specific assistant**, not a general-purpose chatbot. It operates through `ParseChatTools` in `python/ai/chat_tools.py` and can currently support:

- audio setup and file management
- annotation workflow guidance
- cross-speaker analysis support
- export and downstream-pipeline assistance
- troubleshooting across the PARSE workflow

## Tool-surface design constraints

The current README calls out two important operational boundaries:

- write-capable tools are intentionally gated
- onboarding is **one speaker at a time**

Multi-source speakers may still require manual or virtual-timeline coordination because PARSE does not yet auto-align multiple WAVs into a single shared annotation timeline.

| `export_complete_lingpy_dataset` | Export LingPy TSV + NEXUS, optionally refreshing contact lexeme references first |

## MCP subset versus in-app tool surface

Not every in-app chat tool is exported over MCP, and MCP also exposes 3 workflow-only macros that live outside the built-in 47-tool chat surface.

- **Built-in chat tools**: 47
- **Default MCP task tools**: 32
- **Default MCP adapter surface including `mcp_get_exposure_mode`**: 33
- **Full MCP adapter surface with `expose_all_tools=true`**: 51

For the exact MCP subset, startup instructions, and usage examples, see [API Reference](./api-reference.md).
