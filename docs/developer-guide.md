# Developer Guide

> Last updated: 2026-04-24
>
> This guide is for contributors working on the active PARSE codebase: the React + Vite frontend in `src/`, the Python backend in `python/`, and the current workflow-specific documentation split under `docs/`.

## Project summary

PARSE is a browser-based dual-mode workstation for linguistic fieldwork and historical-comparative analysis.

Current architectural highlights:

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Python API server in `python/server.py`
- **Modes**: Annotate (`/`) and Compare (`/compare`) in one unified shell
- **Data**: per-speaker annotation JSON + `parse-enrichments.json`
- **AI**: task-routed provider system for STT, ORTH, acoustic IPA, and chat
- **Automation**: built-in chat tooling plus MCP server mode

## Local development flow

### Preferred launcher

Use the tracked launcher from the repo root:

```bash
./scripts/parse-run.sh
```

This:

- integrates latest code (unless skipped)
- clears stale Python/Vite processes
- starts the backend on `8766`
- starts Vite on `5173`
- prints the active URLs
- preserves the current `parse-run.sh` launcher behavior, including port preflight checks and Windows-process cleanup when `PARSE_PY` points at a Windows `python.exe`

### Manual launch

If you need separate terminals:

```bash
cp config/ai_config.example.json config/ai_config.json

# Terminal 1
/path/to/python python/server.py

# Terminal 2
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Built frontend path

For non-dev/local-server usage:

```bash
npm run build
/path/to/python python/server.py
```

The Python backend can then serve the built frontend from `http://localhost:8766/`.

### Compute runtime modes and deployment notes

The current backend runtime is not limited to one execution model.

It supports:

- `thread` mode — the default in-process path
- `subprocess` mode — useful when isolating compute execution matters more than startup time
- `persistent` mode — keeps the wav2vec2-heavy worker warm across jobs

Relevant knobs and files:

- `PARSE_COMPUTE_MODE` or `python python/server.py --compute-mode=...`
- `PARSE_USE_PERSISTENT_WORKER=true` for the persistent-worker path
- `GET /api/worker/status` for persistent-worker health checks
- `deploy/pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs` for PM2-supervised deployments

If you use PM2, keep `cwd` pointed at the **live workspace** rather than the bare git checkout so runtime artifacts land where the active UI expects them.

## Workspace model

PARSE can run directly in the repo, but the intended fieldwork architecture is workspace-first.

When `PARSE_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is set:

- runtime files land in that workspace
- imports hydrate that workspace
- the UI reflects the live workspace behind `/api/config`

Contributors working on import, annotation, or automation features should always remember that the active project state may be outside the git checkout.

## Frontend development rules that matter in practice

The current PARSE architecture expects:

- API traffic to go through `src/api/client.ts`
- shared typed contracts to live in `src/api/types.ts`
- data persistence to flow through the established stores and backend routes
- the unified shell model to remain the organizing principle rather than splitting Annotate and Compare into isolated apps again

For implementation-level architectural context, see [Architecture](./architecture.md).

## Build and validation

Before pushing PARSE changes, run the current project gates:

```bash
npm run test -- --run
./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
```

These are the baseline TypeScript and test checks called out in the current PARSE instructions.

Two additional realities are worth documenting explicitly:

- the project is still in active development, so full browser regression and export verification should be treated as ongoing validation work rather than assumed completed release guarantees
- schema compatibility between frontend and backend is enforced through `/api/config`; if that payload changes incompatibly, update the version constant in both `python/server.py` and `src/api/client.ts` in the same change

For documentation-only work, you should still at minimum:

- read back the changed Markdown files
- confirm relative links
- check `git diff` for unintended churn

## Documentation layout after the restructure

The top-level docs now serve distinct audiences more cleanly:

- `docs/getting-started.md` — install, launch, config, troubleshooting
- `docs/user-guide.md` — end-user workflow
- `docs/ai-integration.md` — providers, models, chat tool surface
- `docs/api-reference.md` — HTTP + MCP reference
- `docs/architecture.md` — system design and data model
- `docs/developer-guide.md` — contributor-facing implementation guide
- `docs/research-context.md` — thesis and citation framing

Existing planning and historical material remains available under the existing `docs/`, `docs/plans/`, and `docs/archive/` structure.

## How to add a new HTTP endpoint

When adding an endpoint, keep the client/server contract explicit.

### 1. Add the server route

Implement the route in `python/server.py` by wiring it into the relevant dispatch method:

- `_dispatch_api_get`
- `_dispatch_api_post`
- `_dispatch_api_put`

### 2. Add or update the typed client helper

Expose the route from `src/api/client.ts`.

This keeps the frontend on a single typed access layer instead of scattering raw `fetch()` calls.

### 3. Update shared types if needed

If the payload shape changes, update `src/api/types.ts` or the helper-local interfaces.

### 4. Update the docs

At minimum update:

- `docs/api-reference.md`
- `docs/architecture.md` if the new route changes the data model or workflow surface
- the root `README.md` if the change is user-visible enough to belong on the landing page

## How to add a new chat tool

The built-in assistant works through `ParseChatTools` in `python/ai/chat_tools.py`.

For high-level MCP-only workflow macros, use `python/ai/workflow_tools.py` instead. Those tools should stay thin orchestration layers over existing low-level tool handlers and publish their own `ChatToolSpec` metadata.

A new tool should follow this pattern:

1. Add the new `ChatToolSpec` entry in `python/ai/chat_tools.py`
2. Implement the execution path and validation logic in the same tool layer
3. Decide whether the tool is:
   - read-only / preview
   - job-triggering
   - alignment / correction
   - tag-related
   - write / export / merge
4. Update `docs/ai-integration.md` to keep the 47-tool list current
5. If the tool should also be exposed externally, add it to the MCP adapter and update `docs/api-reference.md`

### Why this matters

PARSE's AI layer is designed around **bounded workflow tools**, not arbitrary shell execution. New tools should preserve that design discipline.

## How to expose a tool over MCP

The MCP adapter lives in `python/adapters/mcp_adapter.py`.

To expose a tool over MCP:

1. Ensure the underlying functionality already exists in `ParseChatTools` or `WorkflowTools`
2. Add a matching `@mcp.tool()` wrapper in `python/adapters/mcp_adapter.py`
3. Keep parameter naming and documentation aligned with the underlying tool
4. Re-check the exported-tool count and update docs if the MCP subset changed

The adapter is intentionally a curated PARSE tool surface. Low-level browser/chat tools live in `ParseChatTools`; high-level agent workflow macros live in `WorkflowTools`.

## How to add or extend a CLEF provider

CLEF providers live under `python/compare/providers/`.

A provider change usually touches three layers:

1. provider implementation / metadata under `python/compare/providers/`
2. any server-side compute or coverage handling
3. Compare-mode UI surfaces that consume the results

When extending CLEF:

- keep the provider registry explicit
- document new coverage or source assumptions
- update the provider list in user-facing docs if the provider set changes

## Contributing guidelines

### Keep claims aligned with code

PARSE moves quickly. Documentation, API surface, and workflow details can drift unless they are updated together.

A good rule:

- if a feature changes the user workflow, update the relevant `docs/*.md`
- if it changes the route/tool surface, update `docs/api-reference.md`
- if it changes system shape, update `docs/architecture.md`
- if it changes the first impression of the project, update `README.md`

### Keep workflows explicit

PARSE is a fieldwork/research tool. Contributors should prefer:

- explicit job boundaries
- visible status reporting
- human-reviewable outputs
- reproducible export paths

### Preserve the workspace mindset

Be careful with any change that assumes the repo itself is the live data root. In active PARSE usage, the workspace may be external and mutable while the repo remains a code checkout.
