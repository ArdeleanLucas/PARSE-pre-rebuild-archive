# PARSE — Phonetic Analysis & Review Source Explorer

**Browser-based dual-mode workstation for linguistic fieldwork.**
Annotate per-speaker recordings with tiered IPA/orthography, then compare across speakers for cognate adjudication, borrowing detection, and export-ready historical-linguistic datasets.

<!-- TODO: Add a hero GIF here showing the unified React shell: Annotate waveform + tiers, Compare concept matrix + CLEF panel, and the AI chat dock. A wide GitHub-friendly GIF or screenshot strip would work well. -->
<!-- TODO: Add 2-3 static screenshots below the hero once the current UI settles: Annotate mode, Compare mode, and Lexeme Search / CLEF panels. -->

> **Status**: Active development. Thesis-critical features are landing frequently, interfaces and file contracts are still evolving, and PARSE should currently be treated as research software rather than beta software.

## ✨ What Makes PARSE Different

- **Dual-mode unified React shell** for annotation and comparison in one workspace
- **Fieldwork-first design** for long recordings, uneven metadata, and iterative review
- **AI-native workflow surface** with a built-in chat assistant powered by **50 PARSE-specific tools**
- **Full MCP server mode** exposing a curated **32-tool task surface** by default (**36** adapter tools including workflow macros + `mcp_get_exposure_mode`)
- **CLEF — Contact Lexeme Explorer Feature** for borrowing adjudication via a 10-provider contact-language lookup stack
- **Lexical Anchor Alignment System** for locating repeated lexical items across long recordings and across speakers
- **Export pipeline** for LingPy TSV and NEXUS outputs used in downstream comparative workflows

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArdeleanLucas/PARSE.git
cd PARSE
./scripts/parse-run.sh
```

On a fresh clone, you will usually also want to:

- run `npm install` once
- copy `config/ai_config.example.json` to `config/ai_config.json`
- review your local model/provider settings before serious speech work

Open:

- **Annotate**: http://localhost:5173/
- **Compare**: http://localhost:5173/compare

For full requirements, workspace setup, GPU/model configuration, and troubleshooting, see [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md).

## 🛠️ Core Concepts

### Annotate Mode (`/`)

**Annotate** is the per-speaker segmentation and transcription workstation.

It combines:

- **WaveSurfer 7** waveform review for long recordings
- **Four annotation tiers**: IPA, orthography, concept, and speaker
- **Stacked transcription lanes** for STT, IPA, and ORTH with synchronized horizontal scrolling and inline edit / split / merge / delete controls
- **Audio normalization**, **speaker-level STT**, **ORTH transcription**, and **acoustic IPA fill** jobs
- **Tier 2 forced alignment** with wav2vec2 for tighter word-level boundaries
- **Per-speaker undo/redo** for annotation edits, including merge recovery and STT-tier migration
- **Draggable timestamp correction** and clip-bounded playback for manual review
- **Batch transcription** with preflight checks, per-step **Keep / Overwrite** scope controls, and rerun-failed support
- **Timestamp-offset detection/apply workflows** for constant CSV↔audio misalignment, now with async progress, crash-log surfacing, and protection for manually adjusted / anchored lexemes
- **Search & anchor lexeme** tooling built on the Lexical Anchor Alignment System
- **Shared tags** and the in-session **AI chat dock**

Annotate mode is where PARSE turns long, messy field recordings into time-aligned annotation data without forcing the user into disconnected tools.

### Compare Mode (`/compare`)

**Compare** is the cross-speaker review workspace.

It provides:

- A **concept × speaker matrix** for side-by-side lexical comparison
- Cognate controls for **accept**, **split**, **merge**, and **cycle**
- Per-row editing, speaker flags, and secondary actions for review work
- **Borrowing adjudication** aided by contact-language similarity evidence, dynamic primary-language similarity columns, and selectable reference forms
- **Enrichment overlays** for computed comparative metadata
- The **CLEF** panel for multi-source contact-language lookup, provenance-aware **Sources Report**, and retryable populate workflows
- The same shared **tag system** used in Annotate mode
- Export to **LingPy-compatible TSV** and **NEXUS** for downstream phylogenetic analysis

Together, Annotate and Compare cover the full movement from speaker-specific audio review to cross-speaker historical analysis.

### AI Workflow Assistant

PARSE includes a built-in **domain-specific chat dock** powered by the configured LLM provider.

This assistant is not a generic chatbot. It operates through `ParseChatTools` and can inspect project state, guide annotation workflows, trigger jobs, help interpret comparative results, and support onboarding, export, and troubleshooting inside the same workstation.

Supported LLM backends currently include **xAI (Grok)** and **OpenAI**. Local speech and alignment work is handled separately through faster-whisper, Razhan, Silero VAD, and wav2vec2.

### MCP & External API

PARSE exposes four machine-facing integration surfaces:

1. **HTTP API** on `http://localhost:8766`
2. **WebSocket job streaming** on `ws://localhost:8767/ws/jobs/{jobId}` (override with `PARSE_WS_PORT`)
3. **HTTP MCP bridge** on the same server for schema discovery + tool execution
4. **stdio MCP adapter** in `python/adapters/mcp_adapter.py`

That means external agent clients such as Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Hermes, Windsurf, Codex, or other MCP-capable tools can call a curated subset of PARSE functions programmatically, without going through the browser UI.

Current counts:
- **50** built-in `ParseChatTools`
- **3** workflow macros in `python/ai/workflow_tools.py`
- **32** default MCP task tools
- **36** total default MCP adapter tools including read-only `mcp_get_exposure_mode`
- **54** total MCP adapter tools with `config/mcp_config.json` → `{ "expose_all_tools": true }`

#### Generic job observability

- `GET /api/jobs` — list recent jobs with status / progress / type filters
- `GET /api/jobs/{jobId}` — read one generic job snapshot, including `errorCode`, `logCount`, and lock metadata
- `GET /api/jobs/{jobId}/logs` — read structured per-job logs (and crash-log tails when present)

These endpoints back the in-app progress UI, the MCP observability tools, and callback-driven external automation.

#### WebSocket job streaming

- `ws://<host>:<PARSE_WS_PORT or 8767>/ws/jobs/{jobId}`
- current v1 event types: `job.snapshot`, `job.progress`, `job.log`, `stt.segment`, `job.complete`, `job.error`

Streaming is additive: HTTP polling, callbacks, and MCP observability still work exactly as before.

#### OpenAPI and interactive docs

- `GET /openapi.json` — full OpenAPI 3.1 spec
- `GET /docs` — Swagger UI
- `GET /redoc` — ReDoc

#### HTTP MCP bridge

- `GET /api/mcp/exposure`
- `GET /api/mcp/tools`
- `GET /api/mcp/tools/{toolName}`
- `POST /api/mcp/tools/{toolName}`

These endpoints expose the MCP schema, strict parameter JSON schemas, and PARSE-specific safety metadata (`meta.x-parse`) over plain HTTP.

#### Authentication model

- The local PARSE HTTP server is **not bearer-protected**; it is intended for local workstation use.
- Provider credentials are managed separately through `/api/auth/*` and stored locally in `config/auth_tokens.json`.
- Supported auth methods currently include:
  - direct API keys via `POST /api/auth/key`
  - OpenAI device/OAuth flow via `POST /api/auth/start` + `POST /api/auth/poll`

#### Python package

Task 5 also adds the official publishable package scaffold:

- `python/packages/parse_mcp/`
- package name: **`parse-mcp`**

It provides:
- schema discovery from a running PARSE server
- HTTP tool execution against the MCP bridge
- framework wrappers for:
  - LangChain
  - LlamaIndex
  - CrewAI

## Research Workflow in One Pass

PARSE is designed around a real fieldwork sequence rather than a toy demo sequence:

1. **Load or import one speaker** into the active workspace
2. **Normalize audio** and inspect the waveform
3. **Run STT / ORTH / IPA support jobs** to seed time-aligned review
4. **Correct timestamps and confirm segments** in Annotate mode
5. **Search and anchor difficult lexemes** across long recordings
6. **Compare the concept set across speakers** in the matrix view
7. **Use CLEF evidence** when a borrowing analysis needs external lexical context — the first time you run **Borrowing detection (CLEF)** from the Compute panel, PARSE opens a guided setup modal where you pick 1–2 primary contact languages (English + Spanish by default) and optionally auto-populate lexeme forms from the provider stack. The config lives in `config/sil_contact_languages.json`; extend the language picker with `config/sil_catalog_extra.json`. Each language now also carries an ISO 15924 `script` hint so bare Reference Forms route deterministically between IPA-like Latin text and non-Latin script text.
8. **Export LingPy TSV or NEXUS** for downstream comparative and phylogenetic analysis

The guiding principle is simple: timestamps are central, human review stays explicit, and automation should make linguistic judgment faster rather than opaque.

## Core Runtime Notes

A few practical details matter up front:

- The active frontend is **React + Vite** in `src/`
- The Python backend in `python/server.py` powers AI routes and can also serve the built frontend
- The preferred development URLs are:
  - `http://localhost:5173/`
  - `http://localhost:5173/compare`
- After `npm run build`, the Python server can serve the built UI at:
  - `http://localhost:8766/`
  - `http://localhost:8766/compare`
- `config/ai_config.json` is machine-local and gitignored; start from `config/ai_config.example.json`
- For real fieldwork usage, PARSE is intended to run against a **workspace root outside the git checkout**
- PARSE is still in active development; the repository has explicitly treated full browser regression and export verification as ongoing validation work rather than fully settled release guarantees

Those details are expanded in [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) and [Developer Guide](docs/developer-guide.md).
